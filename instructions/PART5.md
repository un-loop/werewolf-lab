# Polling App: Part 5

## Application Success

Great job! Professor Smith is happy with the improvements we made. 

## Requirements

Professor Smith wants to be able to do reporting on the results to do easier comparisons. 

## Implementation

Add a report button. this button will either navigate to another page or load a report view (if you prefer the single page app model). The report
will show a list of technologies sorted by count. It should not contain any buttons or input forms other that a "clear" or "back" button.

This is your last assignment. Enjoy!
