# Polling App: Part 2

## Application Success

Great job! Professor Smith was able to determine that React is currently the most popular choice for DOM manipulation. She thanked us for your work. In fact, she was so pleased with the project, she wants to use it for the next conference.

## Requirements

She wants to be able to poll for more that just the four technologies she used at the last conference. When we asked her what technologies for which she would like to poll, she told us she didn't know. She wants to be able to poll any technologies that conference attendees mention. She needs to be able to add technologies **on the fly**.

## Implementation

Add an input box that allows for additional technologies to be added to the poll. This input box should be always visible. We don't like clutter in the UI, so let's not use a scrollbar. There should be a button to add the technology. "Enter/Return" while in the button should also add the technology to the list. Since it's easy to make mistakes, we should allow for items to be removed from the list as well. Be sure to show a message in place of the list when there are no items. For instance, when they were all deleted, you might say "No Items to Display".

**styling bonus**:
See if you can make the input control look nice by having a nice boundary between the input area and the scrolling tech list. A [blurred drop shadow](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_shadows.asp) of a few pixels on the input area will give a nice transition.
