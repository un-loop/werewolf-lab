#  Polling App

This is a mult-stage project for you to get your hands dirty learning react and how to create server-side rest APIs. It is broken up into 5 parts, which are written as a fictitious scenario where you are tasked to come up with a web app for a company. We recommend that you fork this repository before beginning your work, and then clone that repository to your local machine. This repository contains some template code to get you started. Feel free to use whatever template you wish, you don't have to use ours.

The template code uses dynamoDB. You will need to [Install Dynamo locally](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html) for your development environment. Be sure to also follow the instructions for setting up the AWS CLI and set the fake credentials to enable aws-sdk calls.

Get started with [Part 1](https://github.com/un-loop/PollProject/blob/master/instructions/PART1.md) when you are ready.
